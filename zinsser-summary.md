# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Byung Kim

Today, the American people tend to inflate their writing with jargon in order to sound important. When this happens, the meaning becomes difficult to understand. Therefore too much clutter in a sentence can ruin its purpose, because the reader wastes time trying to understand the meaning, and may even give up reading altogether. It was also noted that corporations always use clutter to hide their mistakes, but anyone can perceive that it comes off as pompous. In order to avoid clutter in writing, one can put brackets around superfluous phrases or words, then choose to remove them later.
